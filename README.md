# Completed an intensive Spring Microservices & Spring Cloud course by in28minutes (Udemy), gaining hands-on, project-based experience in building scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant applications.

Key Learning Outcomes & Work Done:

ðŸ”¹ Microservices Architecture â€“ designed & developed loosely coupled services using Spring Boot

ðŸ”¹ Service Discovery & Registration â€“ implemented with Eureka Server

ðŸ”¹ API Gateway â€“ centralized routing and filtering with Spring Cloud Gateway

ðŸ”¹ Load Balancing â€“ integrated Spring Cloud LoadBalancer for better performance

ðŸ”¹ Fault Tolerance & Resilience â€“ applied Resilience4j / Circuit Breaker patterns

ðŸ”¹ Distributed Configuration â€“ centralized configs using Spring Cloud Config Server

ðŸ”¹ Inter-Service Communication â€“ REST + Feign Client for declarative calls

ðŸ”¹ Centralized Logging & Monitoring â€“ integrated with Zipkin and Sleuth for distributed tracing

ðŸ”¹ Docker & Containerization â€“ deployed microservices as Docker containers for portability

ðŸ”¹ Hands-on Capstone Project â€“ built a production-ready microservices ecosystem from scratch

Impact:
Demonstrated the ability to design, build, and deploy enterprise-grade microservices solutions, integrating multiple Spring Cloud components to ensure scalability, fault-tolerance, and maintainability.
